# Claude Code Configuration Roadmap

> **Philosophy**: Evolve configurations **only when pain points emerge**. Don't build what you don't need yet.

---

## Current State ‚úÖ

**What You Have:**
- 7 specialized agents (Django/FastAPI stacks)
- Symlink-based sync automation across WSL machines
- Basic slash commands (`/lint-and-format`, `/generate-legal`)
- Global preferences in `CLAUDE.md`
- Docker workflow enforcement via hooks

**Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ TDD-enforced development workflow
- ‚úÖ Framework-specific agents (Django vs FastAPI)
- ‚úÖ Multi-machine configuration management
- ‚úÖ Basic automation (linting, legal docs)

---

## Evolution Path: From Pain to Solution

### Phase 1: Current Workflow Optimizations (0-3 months)

**Add only when you notice repeated manual work:**

#### 1.1 Project-Specific Overrides
**When to add:** You find yourself repeating the same instructions for specific projects

```bash
# In each project root
touch .claude/PROJECT.md
```

Example use cases:
- Project uses non-standard file structure
- Specific API patterns for this client
- Custom deployment requirements

**Effort:** 5 minutes per project
**Value:** High for projects with unique patterns

#### 1.2 Common Slash Commands
**When to add:** You ask Claude to do the same task 3+ times

Examples:
- `/run-tests` - Run full test suite with coverage
- `/check-migrations` - Verify Django/Alembic migrations are clean
- `/deploy-staging` - Deploy to staging environment
- `/security-audit` - Run security checks (bandit, safety, npm audit)

**Effort:** 10 minutes per command
**Value:** High for frequent operations

#### 1.3 Validation Hooks
**When to add:** You catch the same mistakes repeatedly

Examples:
- `pre-commit.sh` - Block commits with failing tests
- `pre-edit.sh` - Warn before editing migration files
- `post-bash.sh` - Remind about Docker when running local Django commands

**Effort:** 15-30 minutes per hook
**Value:** Prevents costly mistakes

---

### Phase 2: Team & Project Scaling (3-6 months)

**Add when working with multiple people or large codebases:**

#### 2.1 Team-Shared Agent Library
**When to add:** You work with a team that shares coding patterns

```bash
# Separate repo for team agents
~/team-claude-agents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ company-backend-architect.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ company-frontend-architect.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ company-deployment-specialist.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

# Symlink into your config
ln -s ~/team-claude-agents/agents ~/.claude/agents/team
```

**Effort:** 1-2 hours initial setup, low maintenance
**Value:** Enforces team conventions automatically

#### 2.2 Project Templates
**When to add:** You start 2+ similar projects per quarter

```bash
~/.claude/templates/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ django-vue-saas/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fastapi-microservice/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vue-dashboard/
```

Slash command: `/new-project <template> <name>`

**Effort:** 2-4 hours per template
**Value:** 10x faster project bootstrapping

#### 2.3 Context Management
**When to add:** Claude gets confused in large codebases (10k+ lines)

```bash
# Per-project context hints
.claude/CONTEXT.md

## Key Files
- `backend/services/billing.py` - Stripe integration logic
- `frontend/modules/payments/` - Payment UI components

## Common Pitfalls
- Never modify Invoice models directly, use InvoiceService
- All payments must go through PaymentProcessor
```

**Effort:** 30 minutes per project
**Value:** Reduces confusion in complex projects

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Automation (6-12 months)

**Add when you manage multiple production systems:**

#### 3.1 Environment-Aware Agents
**When to add:** You deploy to multiple environments (dev/staging/prod)

```bash
agents/deployment/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging-deployment-specialist.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production-deployment-specialist.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rollback-specialist.md
```

Features:
- Environment-specific validation
- Deployment checklists
- Automated rollback procedures

**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Value:** Prevents production incidents

#### 3.2 CI/CD Integration Hooks
**When to add:** You want Claude to understand CI/CD context

```bash
hooks/post-tool-use/ci-aware.sh

# Checks if code passes CI before suggesting changes
# Reads GitHub Actions / GitLab CI logs
# Suggests fixes based on CI failures
```

**Effort:** 3-5 hours
**Value:** Faster debugging of CI failures

#### 3.3 Performance & Observability Agents
**When to add:** You manage production systems with SLAs

```bash
agents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance-optimizer.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ observability-engineer.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ incident-responder.md
```

Features:
- Analyze performance bottlenecks
- Add logging/metrics/tracing
- Debug production issues

**Effort:** 2-3 hours per agent
**Value:** Essential for production systems

---

### Phase 4: Enterprise & Scale (12+ months)

**Add only if managing large engineering org:**

#### 4.1 Compliance & Audit Agents
- Security compliance (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)
- Automated audit trail generation
- License compliance checking

#### 4.2 Cross-Project Analytics
- Code quality trends across projects
- Test coverage dashboards
- Technical debt tracking

#### 4.3 AI-Assisted Code Review
- Automated PR review summaries
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Design pattern enforcement

---

## How to Decide What to Build Next

### The "Rule of Three" üéØ

**Only build it when:**
1. You've done the same manual task **3+ times**
2. The task takes **>5 minutes** each time
3. You can describe the pattern **clearly**

### Pain-Driven Prioritization

| Pain Point | Solution | Effort | ROI |
|------------|----------|--------|-----|
| Same instructions per project | Project `.claude/PROJECT.md` | Low | High |
| Repeated commands | Slash command | Low | High |
| Caught mistakes after the fact | Validation hook | Medium | Very High |
| Team inconsistency | Shared agent library | Medium | High |
| Starting new projects | Project templates | High | Medium |
| Large codebase confusion | Context management | Low | Medium |
| Production incidents | Deployment specialists | High | Very High |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚ùå Don't Build:
- **Agents you won't use** - Wait for the need to emerge
- **Overly specific automation** - Make it reusable or skip it
- **Complex hook systems** - Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- **Documentation agents** - Write docs yourself, use Claude for code
- **Premature optimization** - Solve today's problems, not hypothetical ones

### ‚úÖ Do Build:
- **Solutions to repeated pain** - You've hit the problem 3+ times
- **Time-saving automation** - Saves 5+ minutes per use
- **Error prevention** - Catches mistakes before they cost time
- **Team alignment tools** - Multiple people benefit
- **Production safety nets** - Prevents costly incidents

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Monthly Review (15 minutes)
```bash
cd ~/claude-config
git log --since="1 month ago" --oneline

# Ask yourself:
# - Which agents did I actually use?
# - Which slash commands saved time?
# - What new pain points emerged?
```

### Quarterly Cleanup (30 minutes)
```bash
# Remove unused agents
# Consolidate similar slash commands
# Update CLAUDE.md with new preferences
# Archive outdated templates
```

### Yearly Audit (2 hours)
```bash
# Review all agents for relevance
# Update for new framework versions
# Refactor based on lessons learned
# Share best practices with team
```

---

## Success Metrics

**You're doing it right when:**
- ‚úÖ Configuration changes come from real pain points
- ‚úÖ Each addition saves measurable time
- ‚úÖ You use most of what you've built
- ‚úÖ Configuration evolves gradually, not in bursts

**Warning signs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Building features "because they're cool"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Agents/commands you haven't used in 3+ months
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complexity that slows you down
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Copying patterns without understanding them

## Getting Help

### Learning Resources
- **Claude Code docs**: https://docs.claude.com/claude-code
- **Hook examples**: `~/.claude/hooks/README.md`
- **Agent patterns**: Study your existing agents

### Experimentation Workflow
```bash
# Try new patterns in a sandbox project first
mkdir ~/claude-experiments
cd ~/claude-experiments

# Test new agents/hooks/commands here
# Move to ~/claude-config only when proven valuable
```

### Community Patterns
- Share your setup: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/discussions
- Learn from others' configurations
- Contribute back what works

---

## Next Steps

**This Week:**
- Monitor your workflow for repeated tasks
- Note when you give Claude the same instruction twice

**This Month:**
- If you hit the "Rule of Three", create a slash command or hook
- Update `CLAUDE.md` with any new preferences you discover

**This Quarter:**
- Review what you've built
- Remove what you don't use
- Share learnings with your team

---

**Remember:** The best configuration is the one you actually use. Build only what you need, when you need it.
